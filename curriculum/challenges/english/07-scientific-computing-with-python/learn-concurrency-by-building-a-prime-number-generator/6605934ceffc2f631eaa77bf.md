# --description--

To illustrate task concurrency and the event loop's ability to manage multiple tasks, a yield point(sleep/ delay) is added. This simulates the delays in real-world I/O operations, ensuring that CPU-bound tasks do not block others from running concurrently.

After appending the found prime number within the `else` block, introduce a yield point by adding a short delay like this:

```python
await asyncio.sleep(0.000001)
```

# --hints--

You should add the line `await asyncio.sleep(0.000001)` after appending `val` to the `primes` list.

```js
({

})
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```py

import asyncio

async def find_primes(start, end):
    print(f"Finding prime numbers between {start} and {end}.")
    primes = []

--fcc-editable-region--
    for val in range(start, end + 1):
        if val > 1:
            for n in range(2, val):
                if (val % n) == 0:
                    break
            else:
                primes.append(val)
